# Factorio-Ghost-In-Hand
Factorio mod to replace held item with its ghost when the item is removed from the inventory

When a last held item is placed (either by you or by your construction robots) normally your hand would be emptied forcing
you to pick that item again. This mod changes this behaviour, so that when you run out of items, a held item is replaced with its ghost.
