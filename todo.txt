replace held ghost item with an actual item when it gets resupplied by logistic bots?
probably has to be conditional, only when it was mod that put the ghost in hand (and not the player themselves)
probably configurable too



bug: when the item selected on the toolbelt gets deselected, the mod puts a ghost in the hand
- check if can be fixed by listening to on_player_tool_inventory_changed
- otherwise I might have to track all the changes to the toolbar
- this happens only when the selected item on the belt is clicked to put it back (rather than hitting Q)



bug: if I have an item X in hand, and select an item Y on the toolbelt that I don't have,
I end up with selected item on the toolbelt and a ghost of X in hand
