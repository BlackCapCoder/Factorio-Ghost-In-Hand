replace held ghost item with an actual item when it gets resupplied by logistic bots?
probably has to be conditional, only when it was mod that put the ghost in hand (and not the player themselves)
probably configurable too





change thumbnail


bug: when the item selected on the toolbelt gets deselected, the mod puts a ghost in the hand
